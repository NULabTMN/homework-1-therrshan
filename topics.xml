WASHINGTON, March 2.—De
mands for prompt action by con
gress on bills empowering the fed
eral government to act in kidnaping
cases were made in both the sen
ate and house today by speakers,
who called attention to the Lind
bergh baby abduction.
Senator Barbour (Rep., N. J.) who
succeeded the late Dwight W. Mor
row, spoke from the senate floor
while Representative Seger (Rep.,
N. J.) made a similar plea from the
floor of the house.
The house postoffice committee
acted promptly today on a measure
aimed at kidnapers, reporting out
thte bill of Representative Cochrane
(Dem., Mo.) which fixes a penalty
of twenty years in jail and $5,000
fine for sending threatening, black
mail or kidnaping letters through
the mail.
Senator Bingham (Rep., Conn.),
a close friend of the Lindberghs,
said the kidnaping “brings vividly
to the minds of the American peo
ple the need for some legislation to
curb this growing crime.”
Senator King (Dem.. Utah), a
member of the senate judiciary
committee, said the “horrible sit
uation may call for legislation.
“The Lindbergh case emphasizes
the necessity for the government
stepping in, without encouraching
on state powers, to help stamp out
the most cruel and vicious racket
in the nation,” Senator Patterson
said.

HOPEWELL, N. J., March
2.—Charles Augustus Lind
bergh Jr., blue-eyed and fair
haired, 20-months-old child of
Colonel and Mrs. Lindbergh is
held today for $50,000 ran
som.
Seized in his crib Tuesday night
as he lay slumbering and ill of a
cold, the baby was taken away by
kidnapers, one of whom is believed
to be a woman.
With cold daring, the actual kid
napers crept up a short sectional
ladder into the second-floor nur-j
sery some time between 7:30 and
10 p. m., took the child down the
ladder, and left behind the ransom j
demand, a note dropped in the
empty crib.
Lindy Willing to ray
Colonel Lindbergh is willing to
pay the kidnapers the ransom they
demand, it was stated authorita
tively here today, “if they will make
known the means and the occasion !
lor so doing.”
The note, demanding the $50,000
for the child’s freedom, was report
ed to have said in substance:
“We will be back tomorrow
(Wednesday) to talk business. Don’t
talk to the police or the papers.’’ i
Colonel Lindbergh, grim and re
ticent, aided in searching for the
kidnapers, and was represented as
ready personally to enter direct ne
gotiations for the child’s return.
Sensation Is World-Wide
Meantime, the kidnaping created
a world-wide sensation.
Literally thousands of police and
state troopers were put oh alarm
guard, watching highways, and
state and national boundary lines.
Over the teletype wires of the
eastern .states and up along the
Canadian border flashed word that i
one of the nation’s most famous
babies had been stolen.
The kidnaper apparently had not
realized the furore and resentment
their deed would cause.
Police everywhere went to work
with a will to come up with the
kidnapers, while the federal depart
ments of justice, commerce and
treasury in Washington offered to
do all within their power to track
down the criminals.
President Hoover manifested his
interest..
Aviators from many parts of the
country offered their services, and
an air comrade was sent aloft this
morning to see if from the skies
he could see anything along the
roadways of valuue to the search.
The commerce department was
ready also to help with pilots.
Colonel Leads in Search
Colonel Lindbergh, worn by the
anxiety of his predicament, worked
side by side with the state police.
During the night he helped to trace |
down tracks on his property in the |
fastnesses of the Sourland moun
tains.
During the forenoon he went on
a mysterious errand with Lieuten
ant John Keaton of the New Jer
sey state police. They sed away
two men. One of these had approximately size 10 feet; the othei
size 8.
There was mud on the window sill and inside the nursery on the
floor. There were no fingerprints on the window sill.

‘Dislike for Strangers’
May Betray Abductors
By United firess
MEADVILLE. Pa.. March 2.—Strong resemblance of Charles
Augustus Lindbergh Jr. to his father, and his “hearty dislike of
strangers” may lead to early return of the child, his grand-aunt,
Mrs. Hilda Morrow- Mellvaine, Meadville, sister of the late Dwight
Morrow believes.
•The baby looks so much like his father that no one could mis
take his identity,” Mrs. Mellvaine said. -‘And he heartily dislikes
strangers.
"I know he will cry and fuss and be unmanageable with his
kidnapers, possibly betraying them.
“He is unusually bright, walking and talking in a way far be
yond his twenty months. His aunt, Miss Elizabeth Morrow, takes
him to her nursery school in Englewood, N J., frequently.
“After his first shyness he was at ease in the kindergarten,
playing w-ith older boys and girls. He even learned to count to five.
“He can walk faster than many adults. He has some clever
little tricks, too, such as talking on the telephone. If he ever gets
into a room where there is a telephone he will persist in taking dow-n
th receiver, perhaps giving the operator a clew to his presence.”
in a fast car and came back a cou
ple of hours later on foot through
the woods.
Rumor had it that they had vis
ited Flagtown where a group of sus
pected bootleggers were believed
to be.
Meantime. Mrs. Lindbergh, deep
ly stirred, bore up with the cour
age of a Spartan mother.
The first word prostrated her, but
it was not long before she was ex
hibiting the same courage as her
husband, and she helped authorities.
Once she joined searchers for a
short period.
Many Clews Traced
Her burden was all the greater
for she had been nursing the child
several days because of a cold. And
the kidnapers, without even trying
to catch up some quilts, dragged
the baby off, clad only in its “sleep
er.” Moreover, Mrs. Lindbergh is
again an expectant mother.
Many clews were run down, only
to end disappointingly.
Before dawn, a Philadelphia truck
driver reported sighting beside the
rcadway, not fan. from the Lind
bergh home, a bundle which ap
peared similar to a baby or a doll.
Troopers hurried to the scene on
fast motorcycles, but found that all
the man had seen was a bundle of
papers.
More than a dozen motor cars
were reported stolen in New Jersey
yesterday, and these were checked
in the hope of furnishing a clew.
The only one which appeared
hopeful was an abandoned car
found near Hillside, N. J—a car
stolen from a Brooklyn man. Its
headlights were streaming, and it
matched description of a blue Nash
sedan in which two men at dark
Tuesday inquired at Princeton for
the way to the Lindbergh estate.
Dog Fails to See Abductors
Police thought the inquiries might
have been the kidnapers or their
advance men. But they were at a
loss to reconcile this with evidence
that the kidnapers were familiar
with the field in which they op
erated.
A faithful dog, always alert, made
no sound, as far as is known, dur
ing the visit of the kidnaper to
the nursery on the second floor.
The man may have made friends
earlier with the animal.
The kidnaping visit was well
timed. The baby had been put to
bed and Mrs. Lindbergh had kissed
him good-night at about 7:30.
Later in the evening, the nurse
maid, Betty Gow, was startled to
find the crib empty, and the child
nowhere to be found. She gave
the alarm, and then the authorities
were summoned.
But by this time the kidnaper
had a good start.
The ladder the kidnaper used
HOME
TWO CENTS
yielded little help. Evidently he
had been gloved, and his feet either
were stockinged or his shoes cov
ered to blur the shoeprint.
The ladder had cracked as he
came down, and there is a chance
he fell, injuring himself and the
child.
Had Woman Accomplice
His tracks led out of the estate
toward the main road, where a
woman’s footprints appeared. This
gave the clews that the kidnapers
had a woman accomplice, who
should watch over the baby until
l such time as they could bargain for
for their ransom.
A chisel was found in the woods
near the house, but there was noth
ing to link that definitely with the
: crime.
Workmen who had helped to re
build the natural rock house on the
mountainside were checked over to
! see if they had knowledge of any
i prowlers, but so far as police re
| vealed there was nothing yielded,
i All the present and past employes
were said to have been exonerated.
Beside the press and photograph
ers, there came scores of autos with
the curious, and these jammed the
roads nearby for several miles.
The milkman arrived at 10:30
a. m., evidently unaware of the kid
naping, and delivered four quarts
of milk and two pints of cream,
most of which was for the little
baby.
Mrs. Dwight W. Morrow, mother
of Mrs. Lindbergh, arrived at the.
Lindberg home early this morning
to be with her daughter. She mo
tored down from her home at En
glewood and declined to comment
on the kidnaping as she entered the
big stone house.
Fears Child Will Suffer
“The poor child has had a cold
and will suffer,” Mrs. Lindbergh said
broken-hearted. “We have been
doctoring him for several days.”
Colonel Lindbergh, quiet but
manifestly suffering from terrific
strain, said he suspected no one, and
observed:
“They must have got through
that window” pointing to a
screened window which would not
close because it was warped.
Baby Lindbergh was tucked in his
crib at 7:30 p. m. His mother kissed
him good night, after trying vainly
to fasten a loose, warped screen in
the nursery on the second floor.
About 10 p. m. the nursemaid
entered to see that her charge
was sleeping soundly. She found
to her horror that his crib
was empty. She though at first he
might have fallen or crawled out.
But a search of the room soon
showed her that he had been stolen.
She screamed to the Lindberghs.
The police know only that the in
truder had used a ladder, put up
in sections, had scaled it into the
nursery, and there left a note—a
ransom demand for $50,000; then
had scrambled .down the ladder,
making his way to a point down
“Featherbed Lane” toward the main
highway.
Joined by Woman
On this path, according to foot
prints, the kidnaper was joined by
a woman accomplice.
The spot where the kidnaping
took place is remote, situated up a
rocky roadway off a main thorough
fare.
Olie Whateley, chauffeur-butler,
was convinced the kidnaping had
been planned carefully. This con
viction arose from the fact that a
fox terrier, usually alert, was not
heard to make any disturbance dur
ing the evening, leading to the be
lie that the intruder perhaps was
someone the dog recognized.

“Early in the investigation, a noted

According to the News Monday.

price would be raised to $70,000. The
kidnapers’ agent added:
“Tell Lindbergh we can hold out
just as long as he can.”
Seven Notes Received
It was learned from an authorita

ceived at least seven notes from the
kidnapers other than the original
ransom note which was left in the
nursery. The notes, the source said,
were sent first to Col. Henry Breck

in New York. They bore the same
markings as the original.
The second note, it was asserted,
raised the ransom to $70,000 and the
subsequent communications contain

later than the kidnapers specified
the ransom would be raised to $70,000

HOPEWELL, N. J., May 13. New
Jersey authorities, backed by the mighty
police power of the federal government, to
day apparently were on the direct trail of the
kidnapers and murderers of the Lindbergh
baby.
Shortly after President Hoover had
called on the government heads to make the
murder of the baby “a live and never-to-be
forgotten case,’* it dramatically was revealed
that Colonel Lindbergh’s emissaries had been
in actual contact with the men believed with
out question to be the kidnapers.
The revelation came through Dr. John
F. Condon, the “Jafsie of the want ads,” who
paid out $50,000 for Colonel Lindbergh to the
kidnapers, and was double-crossed.
Under examination by authorities, he
disclosed that the men had sent as a “token”
of identification for Colonel Charles A. Lind
bergh the sleeping suit they had taken from
the kidnaped child.
Relentless Hunt Is Pushed

baby and the money was paid, although the little vic

woods.
Authorities, at last, on a definite trail, are no long

harmed, have started relentlessly on the trail of those
with whom Condon dealt.
They have as first clew the message from the
gang to Jafsie, and the knowledge of their w-here
abouts on the night the money was paid in the bronx.
Condon and John Hughes Curtis, the Norfolk
negotiator, moreover are expected to furnish other
information that would guide police to the killers,
now the object of the most relentless and widespread
hunt in the history of crime.

Baby Lindbergh's crib became the symbol of a nation's grief as
word was flashed from Hopewell of*the discovery of the child's body
in a gulley near Ml. Rose. N. J. This photo shows the crib in the

the manufacturer's serial number on a lapel on the collar.
Through this number Lindbergh traced it to the store
where the baby's clothes had been purchased.
He felt then Condon was in contact with the kidnapers,
and the $50,000 was paid out.
When the baby was kidnaped, it wore three garments—
a flannel belly hand, a flannel undershirt and the sleeping
garment. The sleeping garment was missing from the body.
Marshall’s revelations recalled one of the series of news
paper advertisements through which Condon communicated
with the kidnapers. It said. “The package had been received''
and that “the party" considered it “the real goods."
Betty Go\\. who viewed the mutilated body and positive
ly identified it as the Lindbergh baby, was positive because
of the undershirt on the body when it was found.
It had been too long for the baby and she had cut off the
end and sewed a hem with blue thread, Marshall said.
Discovery of the pitiful, mutilated corpse, with the skull
crushed, at Mount Rose Hill Thursday afternoon, less than
five miles from the Lindbergh home, horrified the nation.
The child for which the world has been searching for
two and a half months was murdered soon after the kidnap
ing—perhaps on the night of the kidnaping itself.
Mrs. Lindbergh was at home when they brought her the
news. Her grief and shock were hidden from the world, al
though she was said to be bearing up bravely within the
closely-guarded Sourland hills home the Lindberghs had built.
It had been planned as a safe retreat in which to rear
their child and have their home life.

of April 2 when Lindy drove "Jafsie" to a cemetery rendezvous

Then early today Dr. Phillip D. Inges, New York, phy

It was 3:15 p. m. Thursday when a Negro truck driver
and his helper found the skeleton in a clump of woods about
four and a half miles south of the Lindbergh home near the
tiny hamlet of Mt. Rosp.
The baby had been killed, appar

body secreted in the woods about
seventy-five feet, from the road.

By l nilnl Pm
WASHINGTON, May 13. President
Hoover today issued orders to the secret
service of the federal government to “make
the kidnaping and murder of the Lindbergh
baby a live and never-to-be-forgotten case.”
The President, in a brief, terse state
ment, ordered the federal government
agencies never to relax “until those criminals
are implacably brought to justice.”
The President’s statement said:
“I have directed the law enforcement
agencies and the several secret services of
the federal government to make the kidnap
ing and murder of the Lindbergh baby a live
and never-to-be-forgotten case, never to be
relaxed until those criminals are implacably
brought to justice.”
Sends Message of Condolence
The President’s message was flashed immediately
to all the government’s law enforcement agencies, and
sudden activity ran like magic through the depart
ments concerned.
Attorney-General William Mitchell, arriving at
the White House for the Friday cabinet meeting, said
he had relayed the President’s message “to all the en
forcement agencies under my command.’’
President Hoover also dispatched a message of
condolence to the Lindbergh family.
The President's order throws into tho case not only the
department of justice and its various agencies, the prohibi
tion bureau, the treasury secret service and the coast guard,
all the army of the United States, marshals and other govern
ment forces, but conceivably even could extend to the use
of the army and navy intelligence services which extend to
almost every corner of the earth.
Trained Detectives Are Available
One important phase of the federal activity periainet
to the $50,000 in notes paid by Lindbergh in the ransom hoax.
Secret service men have been pursuing clews with all
the deftness and skill accumulated during a long period of
success in this field of detection.
' It was regarded as highly improbable that the trained
investigators assigned to the case would fail to get result*.
Passage of federal legislation which at least could reach kidnapers
who take advantage of present deficiencies in laws by fleeing from one
state to another seemed certain.
Senator Roscoe C. Patterson 'Rep.. Mo.), author of a bill before the

New York and New Jersey
Officers in Boston to Probe '
Lindbergh Case. j
BULLETIN.
BOSTON. October 24 OP).—Lieut
James Finn of the New York Police
Department today said that infor
mation gained from John Gorch
provided a clue to the kidnapers
of the Lindbergh baby. Finn said:
"Gorch provided us with names I
and addresses in New York. These
will have to be checked up. What j
they will prove to be I can't say 1

By the Associated Press.
BOSTON. October 24—Police offi
cials of New York and New Jersey
came to Boston today and questioned
John Gorch, 37, in an effort to deter
mine whether he had anything to do
with the collection of $50,000 ransom
money paid for the kidnaped Lindbergh
baby.
Lieut. James Finn, a member of the
New York Police Department, who at
one time served as bodyguard for Col.
Charles A. Lindbergh and who has
never relinquished the search for the
baby's kidnapers, came to Boston, ac
companied by Corpl. William F. Home,
representative of Col. H. Norman
Schwartzkopf of the New Jersey State
police.
Before going to the Charles Street
Jail, where Gorch is confined, the offi
cers conferred with Deputy Supt. James
McDevitt at headquarters.
So important is Gorch considered in
the renewed Investigation of the pay
ment of $50,000 at a time when the
body of the slain Lindbergh baby was
lying beside a roadway at Hbpewell,
N. J„ that Dr. John F. Condon, known
as “Jafsie” during the investigation of
the kidnaping, was reported ready to
come to Boston to view Gorch.
During the transaction Dr. Condon
knew the man with whom he was deal
ing only as “John, the Pole.” Police
point out that not only is Gorch’s first
name John, but also he is Polish ex
traction and at one time lived near
HopeweU.
Local officials of the Department of
Justice announced today that a com
parison at Washington of the serial
numbers of five $100 bills and several
smaller notes found on Gorch showed
they were not a part of the Lindbergh
ransom money. Federal agents con
tinued, however, to study his story of
his movements since the Lindbergh
kidnaping.

NEW YORK, October 24 OP).—Dr.
John F. Condon, known as “Jafsie” dur

New York, Sept. 26.—(AP) —Bruno
Richard Hauptmann, unemployed
German carpenter illegally in this
country, was indicted by a Bronx
county grand jury Wednesday on a
charge of extortion as the receiver of
the $50,000 Col. Charles A. Lindbergh

in three hours after Col. Lindbergh
had appeared before the grand jury
and told them his own story of the
ransom negotiations conducted
through Dr. John F. Condon. Bronx
educator and the “Jafsie” of the ran

but one count, alleging extortion of
the $50,000 ransom payment.
At District Attorney Foley’s office

would be arraigned Thursday on a
bench warrant issued when the in
dictment was handed up.

she heard of her husband's death.
She broke away from friends

She remained behind the locked

with her to come out.
In her room on the eighth floor

"Oh, niy God!" she shouted.
"Oh why did you do this to hini!"|

By HARRY FERGUSON
(Copyright 1936 by United Prcs-,)
TRENTON, N. J., April 4.—
(UP)—The slate of New Jersey,
which sper.t $1,200,000 to capture
and convict Bruno Richard Haupt
mann, executed thim last night
with a penny s worth of electric
ity.
Hauptmann entered the door of
the death house at i-tate prison at
8:41 p. m.
The first of three shocks went
through his body at 8:42 1-2.
Physicians pronounced him dead
at 8:47 1-2 p. in.
Before his body ever hung loose
and heavy against the straps of
the electric chair, officials collect
ed from witnesses a dozen affi
davits, swearing that Hauptmann
had died in the place, time and
manner prescribed by law. Then
they closed their four-year file on
the murder of Charles A. Lind
bergh, Jr.
Hauptmann died without con
fessing.
Not a word passed his lips as he
entered the electrocution chamber
and he needed no assistance when
he sat down in the chair.
Nothing that a man covets —
money, security for his family,
not even the prospects of escap
ing the thunderbolt that hit him
last night—could persuade Haupt
mann to tell why and how and
he kUUd Liodbsrgh
baby.
His failure to confess left a
trail of doubt around the world.
Millions, including the governor
of New Jersey, believed no one
man could have committed the
crime, and that the law did only
part of its work on the spring eve
ning four years and a month from
the night when the Lindbergh
baby was kidnaped.
For these millions, a murdered
child still cries out for vengeance
and they will believe through all
their years that sometime and
somewhere a frightened m in is
?oing to whisper from his r'c? h
bed that he, too, had a part in the
bloody business on Sourland
mountain.
But when Hauptmann walked
to his death he did so in the
knowledge that his lawyers and
his wife, Anna, had tried and test
ed every safeguard' of the law and
that he still stood convicted and
guilty.
For one breathless fragment of
a minute last night every heart
stood still in the little white-wall
ed room where death and Haupt
mann met. It was when the door
swung.
There stood tiauptmann s
For five beats of your heart he
did not move, but waited for the
door to come wide enough for him
and his guards to get through.
It was his eyes yoli noticed
first. They were strange, unblink
ing eyes—cold eyes of washed-out
blue.
They had dressed him for death
in a gray shirt open at the throat,
in shapeless brown trousers and
bedroom slippers. At first glance,
only his eyes identified him as be
ing the man who sat directly in
front of the United Pi-ess cor
respondent at FlentSr^ton dur
ing the six weeks of his trial.
They had clipped the hair of his
skull, and it gleamed, white and
hard ?n the light.
Robert Elliott, the executioner,
stood beside a bucket of brine in
which he was soaking the sponges
to be u:M?d on Houptmann—a
wrinkled old mechanic of death,
puttering around with his tool?.
Thw were more than 60 persons
crowded into one corner of the
room, hut if Hauptmann saw
them th*y must, have been noth
ing but a blur of face* to him.
Only one thing stands out dark
and stark in that white room—
the oak chair with its heavy
leather straps.
And that chair was the fir?1
thing Hauptmann saw aa he canu
through the door with a guard
grasping each arm. It was not the
first time he had looked death in
the eye. He saw it down tbc stun
by barrel of a machine gun dur
ing the World war; saw it coming
at him across the fields in the
shape of men dressed in French
horizon bltse and British brown.
But he couki fight back st death
then, give it blow for blow and
come through, as he did, un
scathed. There was no fighting
back now, and he knew it.
His face was pasty, mayba with
fright and maybe only with the
pallor that prison puts on men
who never see the sun. He seemed
to have courage, if courage means
that the brain tells the legs , to

BY REX COLLIER,

(Copyright. 1932. by The Washington Star.)
NEW YORK. April 16 —Revelations concerning the futile flight
to Marthas Vineyard two weeks ago by Col. Lindbergh and three com
panions, including disclosure that the mysterious fourth member of
the party was a Federal officer, Elmer L. Irey, of Capone investiga
tion fame, can be made tonight on indisputable authority.
Lured by a heart-rending bit of Baby Lindy's sleeping garment.
Lindbergh, irey. Col. Henry Breckinridge and Dr. John F. Condon
(Jafsie) conducted an all-day search by air April 3 for the Nellie, a

yacht on wmcn the quartet expected to find
the kidnaped baby in custody of two "inno
cent” women.
Women Were to Be Questioned.
Irey, chief of the Internal Revenue Bu- j
reau’s intelligence unit, was ready not only,
to tender Uncle Sam's aid in recovering
Charles Augustus, jr., but to question the i
women as to their connection with the case. |
Through it all Col. Lindbergh held to a de
termination to play fair with the kidnapers
if they kept faith with him under the solemn
contract entered into by Jafsle in the melo
dramatic surroundings of a graveyard.
In accordance with this “code of honor”
Lindbergh requested Irey and his two “aces.”
Frank Wilson and A. P. Madden, to remain
aw'ay from the actual scene of the $50,000
ransom transaction, but permitted Irey to
join in the climactic quest for the baby and
its “guiltless” guardians.
Respects 8-Hour Start Demand.
The kidnapers had demanded eight hours’ start after payment 1
of the ransom, and Lindbergh, not suspecting a trick, allowed that I
period to expire before he launched the hunt for the Nellie off Cutty- I
hunk, Mass. ___'

belief that the kidnapers would keep
faith was the ‘ little package” delivered
to Dr. Condon April 1 It was half
of an infant's sleeping dress. Col. and
Mrs. Lindbergh and Betty Gow. the
nurse, were convinced after careful ex
amination of the garment that it was,
as Jafsie said in a newspaper advertise
ment, “the real article."
Stakes All on Pledges.
Without waiting to press further his
reiterated requests for the baby’s flnger
; prints, for comparison with a set of
! latent" prints obtained from toys and
! furniture in the nursery, Lindbergh,
with the advice of others, decided to
pin all his hopes on the pledges of
those who had stolen his son.
The baby’s garment was delivered on
Friday, April 1. The ransom was paid
the next night by Dr. Condon, who
handed to a shadowy figure behind a
cemetery wall a box containing the
$50,000 in five, ten and twenty dollar
bills. Most of the circumstances of that
transaction already have become public.
The Star now can reveal many of the
events that Immediately followed pay

On Saturday night, about 9:30
o’clock. Col. Lindbergh, Col. Breckin

fighter, dAve in Lindbergh's car to the
Bronx home of Dr. Condon. They car
ried two black suitcases and an arm
ful of heavy wraps.
Col. Lindbergh and Dr. Condon, w'ith
the $50,000 in a box. then drove to the
eerie rendezvous with the emissary of
the kidnapers. Col. Lindbergh remain
ing a short distance away in the car.
Dr. Condon was accosted as he walked
along the cemetary wall and he turned
the box and its contents over to a man
of Scandinavian or Teutonic accent,
whom he recognized from previous
meetings.
designated in the letter soon was recog
nized, with a concerted cry of elation.
All eyes were strained for a glimpse
of the yacht called "Nellie."
But the Nellie was not there.
Nearby, however, could be seen a
number of boats, scattered along the
inlets and bays.
Search in Vain.
Lindbergh zoomed down again and
again, until it seemed the undercarriage
cf the plane would clip the rigging of
the boats beneath, or touch the sun
tinted waters of the sound. He was try
ing to read the names on the sides of
the craft that seemed to answer the |
general description of the Nellie. I
There were yachts with a wide variety i
of girls' names, except that sought.
Grimly. Lindbergh and his associates j
continued the disheartening search.
The plane circled the Island and ven- '
tured to ether nearby shores of the !
Marthas Vineyard area. It was hopi-d I
the Nellie would see or hear the !
plane and signal to It In some way. j
Perhaps those on the yacht had mis
understood directions of their own j
group and were in the wrong location, j
If this were the case it would be ad- j
visable to cover a wide territory.
With ever-increasing misgivings, the ]
plane continued to circle over the j
neighborhood. At ope time the plane
was landed at the village of Cuttyhunk
and the group went ashore and Inquired
of the seafaring folk there whether they
knew anything of the Nellie.
No one had heard of such a boat In
that vicinity.
Lindbergh Recognized.
Lunch was eaten in the village. It
was during this visit to the town that
Lindbergh was recognized by several of
the residents. One of the villagers
noticed the name "Breckinridge" on a
wallet. It was in this way that word
of the flight first leaked out. It was
not until later that Dr. Condon s
identity was disclosed, and the fourth
man has been variously reported as
having been John H. Curtis. Norfolk
"intermediary": John Fogarty, private
detective, and others.
Lindbergh refused to give up hope.
All day long he wheeled the plane over
Cuttyhunk and Marthas Vineyard. Onlv |
the darkening shadows of eventide in - |
duced him to call the expedition off j
for the day.
Crushed with pent-up emotion, the
searchers returned sorrowfully to New
York that night.
Lindbergh could not bring himself to
believe he had been deliberately double
crossed He argued there must have
been some unintentional slip In the ar
rangements.
Second Flight Made.
Tlie first thing Monday he and Col.
Brecken ridge again flew back to Cutty
hunk and renewed the quest. This trip,
too ended in failure.
Meanwhile Dr. Condon eagerlv had
been awaiting word from his "contact
man.” Tuesday passed, with no message
of anv kind from those who had taken
the $50,000.
On Wednesday. April 6, Lindbergh
was prevailed upon to take decisive ac
tion He had Dr. Condon insert the ad
vertisement asking "What Is wrong.
Have you crossed me?” and he furnished
the Treasury with a list of serial num
bers of the ransom bills.
So far the answer to Jafsie's ad has
been complete, poignant silence.
Directions to Yacht Given.
Dr. Condon was handed an envelop
containing explicit directions as to the
baby's whereabouts. It was in the same
handwriting as that of other letters
which played a part in the negotiations
and it matched the writing in the
original ransom note.
The letter instructed Lindbergh to fly
to Cuttyhunk. a small island off the
“elbow'' of Cape Cod and near Marthas
Vineyard. In a certain location along
the shore of Cuttyhunk. carefully de
scribed so there could be no mistake, it
was asserted a 30-foot yacht, with
“Nellie’' painted on her bow, would be
found.
On the boat, the letter said, there
were two women in whose care the baby
had been placed. These women, it was
stated, were innocent of any complicity
in the kidnaping, and Lindbergh's word
was asked that they come to no harm.
Lindbergh fully intended to do every
thing in his power to grant that plea.
In the event that anything went
wrong with the plans, however, Lind
bergh wranted a Federal officer avail
able. Several possibilities of a slip-up
had been suggested to him. There was
the possibility the yacht would be
found, with the women aboard, but no
baby there. In this event Lindbergh
would have felt fully justified in hav
ing the women subjected to a grueling
interrogation.
Conflicting Emotions.
The wave of conflicting emotions that
followed reading of the letter of in
I struction can only be imagined by those
j not present. Hope fought and con
' quered the specter of fear that lurked
i in the thoughts of the little coterie
j privileged to be in on events leading

' the latter's home and picked up Reich

followed an arllne course northward
to Cuttyhunk.

Ominous Silence

Kidnaping Search
By the Associated Press.
NORFOLK, Va , April 16.—An air of
tenseness, augmented by tight-lipped
silence of the three principals, attended
the work of negotiators here tonight as
another week end, usually productive of
developments, came in their eflorts to
recover the stolen baby of Col. and Mrs.
Charles A Lindbergh.
A silence more strictly adhered to
than at any time during their eflorts to
negotiate with persons they believe to
be the kidnapers served only to add
to expectancy that some move might
be planned to bring an end to their
iengthy eflorts.

The 12 Hauptmann jurors were unan

Thursday, but five were opposed, to
the death penalty.
In the five ballots taken, it was
learned, two women were the first to
switch to the death penalty. Robert
Cravatt held out to the end.
The jurors, information disclosed,

wanted life imprisonment, grew out

IntactNew Jersey Death House Awaits Convicted Hauptmann |
■ ■ ■ ■ «
When a prisoner convicted of murder in New Jersey is condemned to death, It Is in this windowless,
fortress-like building in the confines of the state penitentiary at Trenton that he must await execution.
The death cells concealed by the blind walls are almost as austere, nothing being provided that would
enable the prisoner to cheat the grim electric chair (pictured at right) housed in a small room at the
end of the cell corridor, • vSentenced to Death
Flemington, N. J., Feb. 14.— (JT)
—Bruno Hauptmann, manacled
and listening to his doom, was
silent.
Bruno Hauptmann went back
to his cell in the Hunterdon coun
ty jail, broke down and wept.
Hearing jury and judge order
him put to death as the killer of
the Lindbergh baby, the Bronx
carpenter spoke only to comfort
his wife.BRUNO RICHARD HAUPTMANN
“It’s all right. Annie," he said.
But in the loneliness, the
pseudo-privacy of prison which
has been his lot for five months,
he mumbled unintelligible Ger
man phrases.
Under state law, he will be held
here at least until 11 p. m., Fri
day. Then, 48 hours, having ex
pired since the warrant for his
removal was issued, he may be
taken to the death house at Tren
ton.
Not until Hauptmann is takenThe $14,000 ransom eaehe found U
Hauptmann's garage belongs to Col*
onel Lindbergh, who paid $50,000 ran
som. He is not likely to get it back
until the state is positive it will no|
need it as evidence in a new trial.
Prison precedent combined with'
judge and jury to fix the night of
March 22 as the tentative for
Hauptmann's electrocution.
He was sentenced to “suffer death”
the week of March 18. and Friday is
doomsday in the death house at Tren
ton.
Edward J. Reilly said an appeal
would be carried to the United States
supreme court if necessary.
The first tribunal expected to hear
the plea, the state court of errors and
appeals, meets for its next term late
in May. The court of pardons will
not hear it before October.
The Jurors who sentenced him
showed more emotion than did
Hauptmann as he stood before them
at 10:45 p. m. Wednesday.
With a look of affection, the 36-
year-old prisoner turned to his faith
ful wife and said:
“It's all right, Annie.”
Back in his cell, out of the gaze of
the curious, Hauptmann burst into
tears.
The jurors required more than 11
hours to reach their verdict. They
were closely guarded after the case
ended, but a courthouse report was
that two of the women had held out
for a recommendation of mercy. That
would have meant a life sentence.
There was no mention of mercy
when the jury was polled.
With stuttering words Foreman
Charles Walton, Sr., announced the
verdict. He who had listened to the
evidence for more than six weeks
even twisted the defendant’s name in
his fight to remain calm.
“Guilty,” he announced. “We finq
the defendant, Richard Bruno Haupt
mann, guilty of murder in the first
degree.”
An insignificant piece of paper
rustled in his trembling hands. He
glanced at the paper with unseeing
eyes in pretense of consulting it.
A few strides away stood Haupt
mann, jaw set, face so pale and hag
gard it was ghastly in the electric
light. Sharply erect, he tottered
slightly as he heard the foremans
words.
Jadga Imposes Sentence
A few minutes later Justice Thomas
W. Trenchard quietly imposed sen
tence.
0o ended the long Lindbergh kid
nap trail. It began In Fsatharbed
Lane, Hopewell, the night of March
1, 1932, when the wind was bowling
over the lonely Sourland Mountain
on which OoL Charles A. Lindbergh
made his home. It ended in a prosaic,
rural courtroom Uttered with papers
and clgaret stubs.
Thirteen times the death dealing
verdict was recited, on the thirteenth
day of the month.
After Walton had made known the
decision, the court dark sated:
“Members of ~w jury, you have
heard the verdict, that you find tew

mann, guilty of murder in tew first
degree, and so say you anr*

An air of expectancy or a “just

Lindbergh home Friday. Two per
sons visited the Lindbergh home,
one of whom looked like a banker
and the other a nautical looking
person. Rumors had it that the
banker came to arrange for the

HOPEWELL, N. J., April 27.—Col
onel Charles A. Lindbergh Tuesday
issued a statement from his estate
near here, saying he was not in
terested in the overtures made by
A1 Capone, gang leader who is in
a Chicago prison, regarding his
voluntary expressions to aid in re
turning the kidnapped child back
to his mother’s arms.
Colonel Lindbergh said it was his
opinion that Capone had no real
knowledge about the^kidnapping of
the child and that he did not know
the present whereabouts of the
child.
This stand on the part of Lind

	<text>Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa," Missing
From Louvre Gallery.
Celebrated Painting Has Been
Mystery for Four Centuries
Savants Puzzled Ovor Beau
tiful Model's Smile.
Paris.The "Mona Lisa" of Leonar
do da Vinci, the world famous paint
ing for whVch an offer of $5,000,000 is
said to have been refused and which
is reported to have been stolen from
the Louvre in Paris, for 400 years
has been as much a riddle as the
Sphinx itself. But one manSolomon
Reinach, brother of the Reinach of
notoriety in the Dreyfus affairever
has been so brazen as to proclaim
the solution of the smile that
wreathes the face of the woman in
the picture. His answer was laughed
to scorn by art critics. Others have
commented on the painting, but Rei
nach alone authoritatively announced
that the mystery was ended.
The "Mona Lisa" for four centuries
has stoou a monument to French art.
For four years1501 to 1504Da
Vinci, friend of Francesco del Gio
condo of Florence, spent his spare
moments at work on the painting.
The model was Mona Lisa Gherardini,
third wife of Giocondo. According to
Reinach, the lovelike expression on
the face of the model is far from in
dicating love.
Reinach asserts that Da Vinci paint
ed the portrait gratis for his friend,
when she was in deep grief, to divert
her mind. He surrounded her with
musicians, singers and buffoons to
keep her in gentle gayety. He worked
at the painting only when a certain
expression appeared on his model's
face, brought about by a peculiar
strain of music. He bore no love for
her, nor she for him.
Reinach even went so far as to ex
plain the deep melancholy of Mona
Lisa. He declared that she was mar
ried in 1495 and until 1499 had no
children. Then came a daughter. A
death record of Florence, by which it
appears that Fanciulia, little daugh
ter of Francesco del Giocondo and his
wife, Mona Lisa, was buried from the
Church of Santa Maria Novella on
June 1, 1501, is cited by him.
Whether Reinach's explanation is
.true or not, it was not received read-
Da Vinci's "Mona Lisa."
ily by the French. It was known that
Da Vinci had sold the painting to his
patron, Francis I. of France, for 4,000
gold ecus shortly after its completion.
The king kept it locked Jealously in
his gilded room at Fontainebleau,
and upon the death of Francis I.
Louis XIV. had it hung in his bed
chamber at Versailles. Following his
demise it was transferred to the Salon
Carre, where it since had attracted
world-wide attention.
"What is she smiling at?" ever has
been the unsolved riddle. To artists
Mona Lisa's smile became In turn ob
viously saucy, sportive, flirtatious and
even naughty, while plain people
called her the "jocund one."
Taine discovered in the smile that
Mona Lisa had been at least flirting
with Leonardo da Vinci, flattering him
and railing against her husband.
Michelet, the historian, said that he
used to go to the portrait "in spite of
himself, as the bird goes to the
snake." Theophlle Gautier discovered
that the subject of the painting was
flirting with the whole world, "this
strange creature whose look promises
unknown joys and whose expression is
divinely ironic." "She smiles with
mocking voluptuousness on the thou
sands who admire her," was the com
ment of Arsene Houssaye, manager of
the Theater Francais, who saw "shin
ing from that smile only the soul of
Leonardo in love."
Walter Patter revealed to the world
that It was an encyclopedia. "In this
beauty," he said, "the soul appears
with all its affections. All the thoughts
and experiences of the world hav
left their traces on itthe animalism
of Greece, the lubricity of Rome, the
revery of the middle ages, the return
of paganism, the sins of the Borgias!"
And supplementing this, the illus
trious Italian Carotti declared: "She
is the emanation of the intellectual,
sentimental and poetic power of her
time, with all the mystery of the
human soul and all its destiny."
In Europe the painting also is called
"La Joconde" and "Gioconda" and in
art circles it is considered to rank
second in value only to the Sistine
Madonna by Raphael. Both are price
less.</text>

	<text>THE disappearance of the fa
mous "Mona Idsa" of Leonardo
da Vlncl from the Louvre, nt
Paris, Is tho latest nine days'
Wonder In the 'world of art. This great
painting, also known as "La Glo-j
condo," has been pronounced by many ,
tho finest in the world. It certainly I
stands In a list of tho world's half'
dozen greatest paintings and in popu
lar regard perhaps ranks second onlyi
to tho "Slstlnc Madonna" by Ilaphacl.
Some think "Tho Last Supper," also I
by Da Vinci, greater than "Mona j
Lisa," but this sort of comparison is
fruitless, as tho two paintings are
qulto different In subject and treat
ment Walter Pater pronounced "La
Giocondo" as "in tho truest sense
Leonardo's masterpiece."
The painting is a portrait of Ma
donna Lisa del Giocondo, third wife
of Francesco del Giocondo of Flor
ence, both of whom would have been
forgotten centuries ago but for the
genius of Leonardo. It is said that
tho painter worked at this master
piece four years and then pronounced
it unfinished. To keep tho haunting
smile on tho subject's face he had
music and jesters in tho studio. As
wo now know it the painting has lost
somo of tho exquisite lines and hues
it had on leaving Da Vinci's band,
since It has faded through the cen
turies and has been retouched. Yet
even in this imperfect state it has
charmed the world.
Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452,
the natural son of a Florentine notary
and a peasant woman. He was cele
brated not only as a painter, but ns a
sculptor, architect, pngineer nnd scien
tist. He engaged in various engineer
ing and architectural works, divided
his timo between Milan, Venice and
.Florence nnd toward the end of his
life was attached to tho court of tho
king of France, where he died. Out
side of his many paintings ho did
much in sculpture, little of which sur
vives. Ho also accomplished mnny
works in the lino of engineering and
architecture, these being his chief vo
cations. In'sclence he was in advance
of his age, being especially versed in
anatomy. As an artist ho was a con
temporaryand in somo senses a com
petitorof Michelangelo and a teacher
of Ilaphacl, Fro Bartolommeo and oth
ers almost, as illustrious. His schools
at Milan, Florence and elsewhcro wero
tho beginning of n new era hi Italian
art. Ho was great not only as a pro
ducer, but as an lnspirer of others. By
many ho is regarded as tho most uni
versal genius of. tho renaissance period.
In person Leonardo was handsome,
with a fine face, great physical
strength nnd charm of manner. Among
his other accomplishments ho was a
musician. His "Mona Lisa" was paint
ed about 1505, when ho was more than
fifty years old. It was bought by tho
king of Franco and has since been tho
property of the French nation and in
more recent years tho pride and tho
greatest ornament of the Louvro,
where it has been admired by millions
from generation to generation.
Every one Is familiar with the paint
ing or with prints of it, Perhapa more
oopies, photographs, engravings nnd
other reproductions have been mado
of this than of any other painting' in
the world. Ono of tho proofs of its
quality is that tho artistic and popular
verdicts on it agree. Usually tho com
mon herd Is enraptured with things
that the art critics pronounce daubs,
and tho art critics aro enchanted with
somo impressionistic thing that is a
blank to tho man on tho street Dut
"Mona Lisa" is so supremely great
that it levels all ranks nnd compels
praiso from artist and layman alike.
The face, with its dowy eyes and
faint Bmlle, contains everything that
charms ua in womanhood. It is spir
itual, yet has touches of the "earth
earthy," alluring and still elevated and
sweet Tho charm Is one that oludes
analysis, as is the case with all that
is finest not only in painting, music
and poetry, but in nature. Tho effect
is wonderfully heightened by nn al
most weird background of rocks and
streams. This and the uphinxllko ex
pression of tho faco giva n 'mystical
element to tho picture that has per
haps proved its greatest charm. But
I am not enough of a highbrow in art
to trust myself to describe it and re
produce tho estimate of Walter Pater
In ono of tho finest pieces 6f writing
In English literature.
"Wo nil know," ho says, "tho face
and hands of tho figure, set in its mar
ble chair In that cirque, of fantastic
rocks, as in some faint light under
sea. Perhaps of all ancient pictures
timo has chilled it least"
Ho then goes on to descrlbo the
painting as n creation of tho artist's
train and soul rather than a por
trait of n flesh and blood person. Its
Infinite appeal is greater ' than could
have eomo from any physical likeness,
but rather arises from an indefinable
something not subject to decay, some
thing carrying a breath from the eter
nal country. To return to Pater;

The loss of this picture Is regarded
by tho French ns a national calamity.

a part of their very life. It has been re

tlon of tno act. That goes, paradox ana
all.
An interesting fact In this connection
is that several months ago it was re
ported In tho public prints that "Mona
Lisa" had been stolen and a copy sub
stituted in its place. This wns after
word denied, but tho disappearance
now makes it seem a strange coinci
dence, almost a prophecy.
There is one other possible explana
tion. It Is notorious that in Europe
the trade of making fake "old mas
ters" flourishes apace, chiefly for the
purpose of gulling American million
aires. These copies are properly aged
by processes that the fakers know and
nro then sold for fabulous prices to
those who have more money than ex
pert knowledge or perhaps real appre
ciation of "old masters." To do this
work fakers have to ppssess originals
in order that the copy may be as
nearly pcrfoct ns possible. Sometimes
these imitations aro so close that they
fool even the experts.
Somo sucli an organization of fakers
may have taken tho "Mona Lisa" for
copying purposes,, expecting afterward
to return tho origlnnl or a clover du
plicate for n ransom. This would bo
so hazardous a game, however, that
even a league of criminals would

	<text>On August 21, 1911, the picture
was missed from its place in the
Louvre. The guard thought the offi
cial photographer had taken it to
his studio to copy it. as he often did.
It was not until late Tuesday even
ing that the guard announced the
picture had been stolen. After a
hasty search, the heavy frame was
found under a stairway leading to
one of the cloakrooms. A scaffold
against the facade of the Louvre,
in i placed there in connection with the
It installation of an elevator, made itA person acquainted with the inter
ior and provided with keys to the
various rooms could easily reach the
Salon Carre where the picture hung.
Some say the portrait was stolen
as an object lesson, to show how
careless the keepers of the Louvre
were and how easily pictures could
be stolen. Others think perhaps an
artist has stolen it and will return a
reproduction and keep the original,
or that a big reward will be demand
ed and at its payment the picture will
be returned in an indirect way after
the excitement has died down.
More romantic than any of these
conjectures is that "Mona, Lisa" is
another Helen of Troy. Some one
has fallen in love with her and in
desperation carried her off to his se
cret altar where he can worship her
away from the stare of the crowds
and jealously guard her from the
eyes of other worshipers.
Wherever "Mona Lisa" is hidden,
she is carefully guarded, for no trace
could paint' s en rouna! and Paris, as well as
inousanus or signtseers who nave
gazed upon her beauty, are still
wondering and talking of her disap
pearance. </text>

FLORENCE, Italy. December 13?The
authenticity o fthe "Moua Lisa" found
\ Hfirrrday in possesion of Vinccnio
i'erugia was. confirmed by experts
after further examination today.
The picture bears the seals of the
Louvre and other galleries in which it
has been hung; while the traces of re
pairs at the back of the canvas also
are visible. The prisoner was again
interrogated by the police authorities
this morning. He repeated his story
of having stolen the picture as an act
of patriotic vengeance for Napoleon's
depredations in Italy. He displayed
the utmost indignation at his treatment
by the police, declaring it unjust after
the risks he had run and the abnega
tion he had demonstrated out of pa
triotic sentiment.
A number of prominent Italians have
w ritten to the Italian minister of pub
lic instruction requesting him to per
mit "'Mona Lisa" to be placed on exhi
bition in Florence, its former home,
before returning it to the French gov
ernment.
Some weeks ago an Italian wrote to
Signor Geri. an antiquary of Florence,
saying: "I am in possession of the miss
ing 'Mona Lisa," but being a patriotic
Italian I desire that it shall remain in
Florence, the center of Ita'ian art."
He signed the letter "Leonard," and
the antiquary at first paid small atten
tion to it. thinking he had to do with a
madman. Later, however, he communi
cated with Dr. Poggi, director of the
Florentine museums, who suggested that
he continue the correspondence with the
man. This was done, and an appoint
ment was arranged whereby Geri was to
view the picture at Milan. The date set J
v.a- November I", but unforeseen circum
"tancea prevented the meeting.
Recognizes "Mona Lisa."
A young man fairly well dressed, visit
ed Geri Thursday. He said he was
"Leonard" and was staying at the Hotel
Tripoli. He asked Geri to go with him
to see the picture. The dealer notified
Dr. Poggi. who hastened to the hotel,
and on being shown the painting recog
ii'zed it as the genuine "Mona Lisa."
Dr. Poggi asked to be allowed to take
the picture with him. so that he might
ompare it with other works. He made
an appointment to meet "Leonard" yes
terday afternoon at the hotel, to agree
?ipoi the price. The director took with
him several officers, who placed the man
nnder arrest.
? On being interrogated the prisoner said
hi.- real name is Vincenzo Perugia, that
he was born in the province of Como,
Is b> profession a decorator, and is un
married. For six years he lived in
France, and for three years was em
ployed at the Louvre.
Perugia posed .?s a patriot. "I was
ashamed." lie said, "that for more than
a century no Italian had thought of
-.avenging the spoliation committed by
Frenchmen under Napoieon, when they
carried off from the Italian museums and
galleries pictures, statues and treasures
of all kinds by wagonloads. ancient
manuscripts by thousands, and gold by
sacks."
Storen Early in Morning'.
He had often observed, he said, in the
Louvre many works of art stolen from
Italy, and conceived the idea of return
ing to its true home Leonardo da Vinci's
masterpiece. He entered the Louvre
early hi the morning, detached the pic
ture. and removed the painting from the
frame. He concealed the frame under
the back stairs, where it was afterward
f-jund. lie hid the picture beneath his
Turkman's blouse, and succeeded in leav
rns the place without attracting sus
picion.
At the time of the theft Perugia was
not employed in the Louvre, but he knew
all the exits and entrances, and how to
avoid attention. He kept the painting
concealed, he said, until his patriotism
leti him to offer it to the Italian people.
The picture was identified by Dr. Cor
r. do Rieci, director general of the de
T'ai tment of fine arts, who was dispatcn
?J hurrit-dly t?> Florence from Rome by
t ie minister of public instruction, Luigi
Credaro.
Government Acts Promptly.
News of the discovery of "Mona Lisa"
spread in the chamber of deputies, in ses
sion at Rome, where extremist members
?? !-e engaged in fisticuffs in an endeavor
to prevent a vote on the election of a
nationalist deputy for Rome. The disor
ded ceased immediately. The deputies
surrounded the minister of public instruc
tion, who exhibited a telegram from Dr
l{,e*-'i confirming the statement he had
already made by telephone.

Some of thein remarked that Napoleon's

grounds for feuds. If it were not so
Italy would quarrel with the whole world!
ils all countries had stolen masterpieces
from her, not excluding the United
States The famous Ascoli cope, stolen
from the cathedral at Ascoli. which was
returned by J. P. Morgan, was cited,
however, as an instance of American

Senor Credaro announced that Italy
would apply the same generosity, as he
had immediately notified the French am
bassador, Camiile Barrere, of the dis
covery of the painting. He added:
Pomp to Mark Return.

Finger Prints Confirm Confession.
PARIS, December 13.?Rene Viviani,
French minister of public instruction,
announced at the cabinet council today
that there was no doubt the picture
"Mona Lisa" had been recovered and w*
now at Florence, Italy. He said he had
telegraphed to the Italian premier thank
ing him and the Italian government for
their prompt action.
A representative of the line arts de
partment is on the way to Rome to bring
the picture back to Paris.
Fresh proof that "Mona Lisa ' was
taken from the Louvre by Vincenzo Pe
rugia was established today when his
dnser prints taken when he was con
victed some time ago of carrying tire
arms without a permit were compared
wKh those on the frame and glass of the
picture and found exactly similar. The
finger prints on the glass and frame
were preserved by the police and the
similarity with those of Perugia is ap
parent.
Excitement in Paris.
With ' Mona Lisa" found what was one
of the unfathomable mysteries has been
solved. The sensation caused by its re
covery was equaled only by that caused i
by its disappearance in August. 1011.
Special editions of the newspapers car
ried the news the length and breadth of
Paris, and last night it was the sole
topic of conversation.
The Florence dealer, Geri. it is believ
ed. will be entitled to claim rewards ,
amounting to IMO.OOO francs (JMH.000) of- |
fered by the Society of Friends of the j
Louvre and Paris newspapers.
Regarded as Priceless.
"Mona Lisa," or "La Joconde," is one
of the world's famous paintings, and re
garded as priceless. Leonardo da Vinci
took as his model for the picture Lisa
del Glocondo. a woman of Florence. He
worked on the picture for four years,
from lC*JO to 15?4.
It was bought for France by Francis I.
The value of the work can only be imag
ined since all offers to buy it were re
fused. among them one reported to have
been made by the British government of
$3,000,01)0.
The famous painting had hung in the
place of honor in the Louvre in a room
which was supposed to be always watch- j
ed. It disappeared on the morning of
August 22, 1911. and its absence was
not noticed by its guardians until some
hours later.</text>

equaled by that caused by Its disappear
ance tn August, 1811.
Special editions of the newspapers car
ried the- news -the length nd-breadth of
rarts and tonight It was the sole topic
of conversation. The finding ot "Mona
Lisa" had been so often announced, only
to be contradicted, that the news waa at
first received with skepticism, but Am
bassador Barrero's dispatch from Homo
to the French minister of publlo Instruc
tion, though brief, was explicit and the
names of tho eminent Italian experts
mentioned seemed a sufficient guarantee
that It wits the original painting.
Henry Marcel, director general of the
French National museum, for a moment
waa Inclined to doubt the news, saying!
'We have so ofton been cruelly
hoaxed that It (s only natural that we
should foel skeptical that the painting
has been found. The telegram which I
have read seems so clear and shows such
detailed knowledge, however, that It
seems to me the nows must be true this
time. In any case, tho theft .undoubtedly
was. the act of a madman. The motive
given 'to avenge thefts committed In
Italy by Napoleon' dearly shows this.

M, J. T, Homoiele, who was director
of the Lenvre when "Mona Lisa," waa
stolon and who was suspended by the
French cabinet because of the loss of the
painting, waa overcome with Joy when he
learned of Its recovery.
Seymeui de Rlocl, an eminent art critic
of Paris, declared hla faith In the certifi
cation ot Dr. Corrado Rlocl at Florence
pt the' authenticity ot the "Mona Lisa."
"X do not think there Is the slightest
doubt," he said, ''that the painting will
be Immediately restored to 'France.
"Italy has no claim whatever on the
Mona Lisa,' which was given or sold to
the French klnr. Francis I, by Leonardo
da Vlticl himself.
M. Vivian!, minister of publlo Instruc-
Uon, and 11. Jocquler, under secretary
for beaux arts, were both highly elated
over the auspicious event, which ushers

an outraged England arid made all art
lovers weep by hacking the incomparable
Rokeby Venus. She did it to get the
vote. It recalls the most famous of all
art thefts?the stealing of the Mona Lisa
by an Italian to avenge the depreda ions
of Napoleon a century old. The complete
story of that famous mystery only
new may be told with authority.
Smiling the same inscrutable smile
which the master genius, Leonardo da
Vinci, imprisoned upon canvas 400 years
ago to the vexation of generations of interpreters,
Mona Lisa, mysterious portrait,,
restored to her admirers after
strangely vanishing under the eyes of h :r
guards and eluding the frantic search of
a nation of art lovers again looks down
from her place in the Louvre, Paris, the
interest of her subtle, mystic expression
enhanced by reason of her peculiar adventure.
Mona Lisa, or, as the Italians call her.
La G.aconda on account of the haunting
challenge which the artist divined in the
face of his sitter and which he wove into
the fabric of his colors, has enthralled
and fascinated beholders from the beginning.
Many explanatory pages have
been written on the meaning of this
famous painting, and. provoked by its
indefinable charm, its elusive suggestion,
many an art student has brought the
full power of his critical acumen to tne
task of finding suitab.e words for the
description or th3 picture's strange appeal.
Each attempt has failed and ea.h
writer has dwelt with peculiar emphas.s
upon the qualities of the Mona Lisan
smile.

j without the Louvre gates. As the months n
spied by while the endeavors of the police
proved vain and not even rumors came
of a Mona Lisa in foreign lands, all hope
that the picture would ever be recovered
was given up. It was concluded that _
the work had been destroyed. The fate *
of Mona Lisa was put to the account of
one of those unintelligible acts of vandalism
which go to swell the records of hu- ^
man pathology.
Boundless was the enthusiasm, then, K
which greeted the sudden, unexpected re- L
appearance of the Gioconda Thursday, ^
December 11, 1913, at Florence. In Flor- g(
ence the original Mona Lisa had sat for
a portrait by one of the greatest painters w
of all times, and in a dingy inn at Florence
the lost painting was found again. C(
The Italian authorities obtained imme- p;
diate possession of the picture, which h
was taken in triumphal procession a:
through Italy, under police guard to
Rome, to the French ambassador Bar- tl
rere. and, then, to Milan, where the di- w
rector general of the Louvre, Henry Mar- H
eel, and the director of paintings, Jd. Leprieur.
came to take charge if it. The b<
Mona Lisa was again safely housed in in
Paris last New Year day, and was again
hung in its accustomed place at the n,
Louvre, which place had been filled dur- ee
ing the time of its loss by Raphael's p
Castiglione. L
The theft of this irreplaceable work tr
was an extraordinary one, in that the ol
criminal had been able to penetrate one to

ace of the criminal was to be sought a

erly so employed, upon which list ap- f
3ared the name of Peruggia, who, with g

I these men for comparison, as had been i

Peruggia's downfall came with his at;mpt

a dealer in art works, offering, un- ^

	<text>Mona Lisa" Thief on Trial.
Florence. Italy, June 4. The trial
of Vincenzo Perugia, on the charge

"Mona Lisa" from the Douvre in Par

The disappearance of the picture
on August 22, ll'll, caused a sensa

todays' hearing that Perugia was only
partially responsible for his actions.
Perugia did not deny that he had
taken "Mona Lisa" from the Louvre.
He said it was his desire to have

	<text>The Mona Lisa Thief.
In view of the stir caused by
his crime, Vincen^o Perugia, who stole
"Mona Lisa" from the Louvre galleries
in Paris, gets a very light sentence. The
court decrees that he be imprisoned for
a year and fifteen days, of which period
he has already served nearly six months
while awaiting trial, so that in about half
a year from now he will have completed his
penalty for r.n act which caused more stir
in the world than the looting of a bank.
Indeed, mere bank robbing is so common
that Perugia's crime stands out as a
star performance. This possibly emotional.
possibly commercial theft appeared
for a time to be beyond solution, and
probably If Perugia had not undertaken
to sell his loot In Florence the mystery
wouid have remained unsolved. Certainly !
the temporary separation of "Mona Lisa" '
from her place in the Louvre added, if 1
possible, to her value as a work of art.

walk away with what Is probably
tho most valuable art treasure in
tho world.
It was on tho morning of August
22, 1911, that tho world was startled
by the announcement that Leonardo
da Vinci's great masterpiece had
been stolen. IU disappearance from
its accustomed place in tho Salon
Carre, or Square Salon, was noted on
August 21. To some reporters who
inquired Intelligently about its dis
appearance tho officials on that day
explained that It had been taken dovri,
to bo cleaned. On tho following day
the government decided that It was
useless to attempt to conceal any
longer tho fact that It bad been
stolon. Its value was estimated at
$5,000,000.
It is Interesting to recall somo of
tho extraordinary speculations and
theories that were advanced con
cerning Its disappearance. Somo
argued that It was incredible that
a government possession of such In
calculable value could bo taken by
a common thief. Thoy said that
somo person ot great Influence, a
Cabinet Minister or other high offi
cial, had taken tho picture to photo
graph It, had damaged It accidentally
and was keeping It until ho could
repair It.
Another theory was that tho mys
terious psychological and sex influ
ence of tho picture would prove to
bo tho clue to Its disappearance
It Is woll known that this exquisite
and subtly fascinating portrait of
Mona Lisa del Glcondo exerts n
very diverse Influence upon the two
eoxes. Men of Impressionable tern
peramont are strongly drawn toward
it and feel a deep and oven passion
ate pleasure in tho radiations of Its
"onigmatlcal smile." Women, on the
other hand, are, with equal frequency,
repolled by It, and are oven stirred
to hato and fury by the same smile.
The partisans of this theory fell
Into two groups. Ono group said
that a man mentally disordered by
the Btrango fascination of tho plo
turo must have stolon it to enjoy Its
subtlo charms In secret. Tho other
group -argued that a wothan had
taken it to vent .the rage of her
sex upon It.
Ono thing becamo clear from the
mass of theories and Interesting facts
brought out by tho eplsodo. Tho
contents of the Louvro were not, and
novor had boen, well safeguarded.
Plcturos worth from $1,000,000 to
$5,000,000 could havo been pulled off
their hooks at a favorable moment
any day without detection.
Officials, moreover, had boen In
the habit, of lending the art treasures
to artists and persons of Influence.
It was stated that 250 pictures had
boen stolen or borrowed" In tho
course of tho nineteenth century.
Gradually the months wore on and

tho rocovery of tho great" picture
came to be regarded as hopeless.
Then, on December 12, 1913, came
tho news that It hud been found.
An art dealer Informed the director
of the Ufflzl flsllery nt Florence that
an Italian workman named Vincenzo
Porugln had taken the picture and
had It In Florence. This statement
was, verified and the "-Mona Lisa"
returned to France.
The confession of Perugia shows
that tho Bubtle psychological Influ
ence of this picture had, Indeed,
imudh to do with his act.
Perugia said:
"I am a patriotic Italian. I saw
that tho Louvro was filled with mas
terpieces stolen by Napoleon from
Italy. I longed to take something
back.
"I thought of taking n Ra panel, a
Titian a Corregglo and several other
(masterpieces.. But the Mona Lisa
seemed to me much more appealing.
"Hero sho Is. I give her back, to
my country. It Is tho greatest sacrl
flco of my life."
From Perugia's confession It ap
peared that he had worked as u paint
er for a decorating contractor of 280
Rue St. Honore, Paris. He had
worked as a painter on tho Louvro
for some weeks, but gave up this
worK on January 24,
1911. Between this
date and August 21
he meditated upon
and carried out' his
plan for stealing the
Mona Lisa.
It was 7 o'clock in
tho morning of Au
gust -l when he en
tared the Louvre.
The building was
opon then for (tho
workmen and guard
ians or care-takers,
but tho general pub
lic was not admitted
that day.
Perugia wore tho
long blouse common
ly used by French
worklngmcn, ospeci-,
ally by houso paint
ers. Ho looked, ot
course, llko a man
working on the
building. Ho wnlked
straight up" to the
picture In tho de
serted Salon Carre
and took It from the
hooks by which it
was hung. A man
standing on the floor
could reach his hand
to tho top ot tho
small picture.
4. He Leaves It Behind Door at
the Head of a Stairway.
Then he realized that the frame
would be heavy and hard to conceal.
Mo quickly removed the picture
from the frame. H left tho picture
lying in the salon and carried tho
frame to a doorway a few yards
away at. the head of & small stair
way and left It outside the doorl
Then ho roturned, Tor tho picture.
He thrust it under his looso blouse,
whero It was scarcely noticeable.
Hearing footsteps, he decided to
leave hurriedly by the small stair
way where he had left the frame.
As he went out he put tho key in his
pocket to prevent any one pursuing
him that way.
Having rqach'ed, the e?ound. ho
crossed tho Courtyard of tho Sphinx,
and then passed out through tho
gateway known as tho Porte Viscontl,
which faces on the Seine.
The French nutjwrltles summoned
Perugia, together with alKtlie work
men who had worked on the Louvre
at tho time of or Just before the
theftr. He pro.ved that he hail not
worked thero since January 'M, nnd
this seemed sufficient explanation.
No one discovered that he was, tho
thief until he revealed it himself.

	<text>MONA LISA THEFT
WAS LONG PLANNED
PERUGIA, THE THIEF, WAS NOT
ACTUATED BY PATRIOTIC MO
TIVES, AS CLAIMED.
Paris, Dec. 15.—Detective Nicausse
important discovery
among the effects of Vincenzo Perugia,
which seems to throw freBh light in
his theft of "Mona Lisa." The dis
covery tends to show that in taking
the picture from the Louvre, Perugia
was not actuated by purely patriotic
matives, as he prteended was the case,
and that the theft was long contem
plated.
Among the mass of miscellaneous
papers were two notebooks dated De
cember, 1910, the time when Perugia
was employed by a firm of decorators,
which was engaged at the Louvre in
placing glasses on pictures,
writing in the notebooks, the detec
tive says is that of Perugia.
The first book contains a list of cel
ebrated multi-millionaires, including
the late J. Pierphont Morgan, John D.
Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie. The
second contains a list of art dealers
and collectors, not only in the Italian
cities of Rome, Florence and Naples,
but in Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfort and
other German cities. In this list ap
pears the name of Signor Geri, the
antiquary of Florence.
The police investigations have re
vealed the fact that Perugia was deep
ly In love with an exceedingly beauti
ful girl, the image of "Mona Lisa."
Ninety-three fervent love letters from
the girl, signed Mathilde, were found
in Perugia's room,
some years ago Mathilde was brought
to a dance hall by another Italian,
who quarreled with and stabbed her
and then fled. Perugia witnessed the
attack upon the girl, and being struck
by her beauty, lifted her into a cab
and took her to the home of an old
Italian woman, who nursed her back
to health.
The acquaintance thus begun devel
oped into an ardent love affair. The
police hope to obtain from the girl in
formation concerning Perugia which
would clear up the question as to
whether he had accomplices in the
abstraction of the painting from the
Louvre. They have so far, however,
been unable to find any trace of her.

	<text>THE BOSTON SUBWAY
SATISFACTORY SOLUTION OF THE
STREET CAR PROBLEM.
Contention of Trafllc In tli? Iluny Streets
of the Uub Relieved by Underground
Trolley Lines?Tunnels Tlmt Am Light,
Clean uud Attractive.
It is now possible to cross Tromont
street, Boston, at any point opposite tho
Common and at any time of day without
loss of life or limb. Tho new subway has
brought about tho change.
It 1 s an old tradition that tho fathers of
Boston, when thoy laid out tho city, let
the. streets follow the winding cow paths.
At any rate, the streets ius thoy exist today
urc very crooked and must of them aro
very narrow. This was all right in Revo?
lutionary times, but when the city grow
miles beyond tho Common und spread it?
self out to tho south and west; when busi?
ness centered itself along tbu lower ends
of Washington and Trentont streets, and
when dozens of street car tracks usurped
tho narrow roadways, then the Bostonlans
wished their ancestors bud not stuck so
closely to the cow paths.
Probably no other city on the continent,
was ever so badly allllctcd with a conges?
tion of trnllic as tho Hub haslieon for
many yea: Some of tho most important
street ear linen skirt tho south and east,
cornets ol the Common on Boylston mid
Tremont streets. When I he chango was
made hum hoc. epov.vr to trolley, matters
grew worse. Then tho poles and the tan?
gle of overhead wires made that historic.
breathing spot look liko a pieco of dingy,
green billiard cloth which had become fray?
ed and tuttered around the edges. So after
much wrangling in tho legislature and
courts it w;ls decided tu build the subway
and put the trolley cars underground.
A large portion of the work bus already
lieen accomplished and Boston is delight?
ed with the result. The first thing a Hus?
ton man asks a visitor from Now York,
Chicago or elsewhere is:
"Been through tho subway yet'/ Let's
see?you huven't one in your place, have
you?"
It is, in fact, a triumph of engineering
anil well worth a visit. Then! arc throe
open cut.s where tho trolley curs enter the
subway. One Is out on Tremont street
whore Shawmut avenue comes in. Hero
the tracks from each of those jmorough
fares dive into the tunnel. Another is In
the Public gardens, where the cars com?
ing down Boylston street take tho under?
ground tlip. The third is at tho northerly
end of the subway, just beyond-Hay mar?
ket square and in front of the new Union
terminal railroad station into which the
Fitchburg, Hoston und Maine, Eastern
und other roads run. Theru is u. loop hern
DOSTON'S NEW SUBWAY INCLINE IN THE Plin
LIC ns most of the t rolley lines inako it their
terminus, and, the subway being four
tracked, they disgorge their passengers
and take the back track up town.
Including the inclines or open onto, tho
subway has a total length of 1 miles and
will contain about live miles of track. At
present the branch down Boylston street
along the Common side and the main line
down Tremont to Park street are in oper?
ation. The Shawmut avenue branch and
tho northerly end of the main lino will be
finished within the next eight months.
Ground was broken for the subway in
April, 18115. The sum appropriated was
$7,ii(?0,000 and, wonderful to relate, tho
transit commissioners say that it is proba?
ble the cost will bo about $1,000,000 less
than that sum.
No groat difficulties have been encoun?
tered thus far in digging this big liplo In
the ground. Of course there were count?
less sewers, water pipes, gas pipes, electric
wire conduits and the like und some -III
inch water mains at an inconvenient level
proved rather hnrxl to handle, but n? un?
expected conditions arose to delay tho
work. The main trunk of the subway
runs under the wide walk or mall on tho
east side of the Common, anil when the
excavations were being made the bones of
hundreds of old Puritans were disturbed.
This raised a bowl of righteous Indigna?
tion,and the sncredness of the long forgot
burying ground was harped upon for
weeks. Hut the commissioners quieted
the reverent patriots by collecting nil tho
bones and roiuterrlng them in the holy
ground of the Common, with a nice monu?
ment to mark the spot.
The tleepest jioint of tho subway is on
Boylston street, where the south bound
t racks are laid lit) feet lielow the surface,
but the average depth is 14 feet. The tun?
nel itself is a giant bore with ribs of steel
mid casings! of cement, asphalt, concrete
and masonry. The roof is a series of
arches und the floor Is concave, with
drains at the bottom. As tho drnins are
below the level of the sewers, jilts have
been established at Intervals, and when
thev are filled with water automatic elec?
trical pumps are started, which empty
them Into tho sewers above.
Perhaps yon imagine that Boston's sub?
way is a tlark, damp, ill smelling place. It
is nothing of the sort. The entrances to
the stations aro handsome structures of
stone, with glass roofs. The only fault, to
be found with them is that thev remind

RJtlUYBRAVIVO POSTAI* CARDS.
i From The Boston Transcript.
An advertisement has appeared in some of the
daily papers In which a cosh payment has been
offered for uneancelled printed postal cards. It
seems that many business houses have occasion
j to have a large number of postal cards printed
to advertise some special line of goods or for
the use of some travelling man. For some rea?
son or other the conditions may change, so that
perhaps only half of the cards are use?), being
or m'.cd, Lbey can nut be used in any other way,,
j and the result is that in nine CSSSS out of ten
they are consigned to the waste basket, a? the
Government does not red. em uncancelled postal
cards an it does stamped envelopes.
A process has been discovered by which all of
the printed matter may be removed from the
card, leaving it in the same condition as when
bought at the poatofBcn. A charge of one-half
cent per card is- made for this work; or, in other
words, a man sends five hundred carda to be
"made over." The man who does the work
charges f?SO for his services, ami tin- u.?tomer
save? $1* ."?0, as the printed cards were of no uas
to him.

BOSTON'S SUBWAY, SURFACE AND ELEVATED LINES
PRACTICALLY TIED UP BY STRIKE
Boston, June 7. By noon to
day the surface, elevated and sub
way car system of Boston and
suburbs was utterly disorganized.
A strike of the union employes
of the Boston Elevated, which
controls the surface and subway
lines, was called at 4:15 o'clock
this morning after a stormy three
hour session at union headquar
ters. The elevated officials laughed
at the strike. When the union was
formed only a few weeks ago the
elevated set about a counter or
ganization, a "protective" asso
ciation they called it.
This morning the officials of
the company claimed they had
2,000 men in this protective asso
ciation who would continue to
work, and that they had 1,500
strike-breakers already imported
from New York and Philadelphia.
There was a good deal of riot
ing after the strike was called.
Cars wer.e stoned, trolleys discon
nected, motormen and conductors
who refused to recognize the
strike order roughly handled,
le,epers were put on the tracks,
and cautious Bostonians walked
to work this morning.
But the rioting never became
very serious and it was not neces
sary. As the forenoon wore on
motormen after motormen, and
conductor after conductor left
their 'packed cars standing'in the
street and went to union head
quarters to report.
Even wherfe they did not leave
the cars there always was some
one to disconnect the trolley
wires. Then the motormen and
conductors would refuse to get
off to fix it, and the police would
have to do it.
Because the guards at the
Park street terminal of the Cam-
bridge subway reported to the
union the escalators were stopped
and passengers had to climb three
flights of stairs to the street.
There are 3,800 members of the
union. The strike was called be
cause
The company refused to recog
nize the union; announced it
would employ no union .men.
When complaints were made
against men, they were laid off
without pay pending a hearing.
If exonerated and reinstated,
the pay they lost never was made
up. i
Conductors were forced to fur
nish $10 change for each trip.
Despite the company's refusal
of an increase because their
"finances wquld not stand it,"
the "loyal federation or protec
tive asspciation" members' pay
was increased when the union
was formed.
Police Commissioner O'Meara
ordered all the reserves on duty
at the subway and elevated, sta
tions and car barns this forenoon.
There already have been fifty arm
rests, but all the cases were con
tinued until oMnday.
o o
The average length of life in
Norway is greater- than on any
other"part of the globe.

Treuiunt and lloylbtoti Streets.
Boston, March 4. An explosion lias just
occurred in the subway excavation at the
corner of Trcraont and Ooylston streets.
Three electric cars that were passing
at the time were wrecked and one ot
them was burned. Several bulldingsin the
vicinity were more or less damaged.
The explosion was caused by escaping
gas.
Among the buildings damaged are the
Hotel Pclliam, the Knickerbocker and
Head buildings and the Masonic Temple.
Window glass in buildings within 200
feet of the scene of the explosion were
shattered.
At least twelve persons were killed.
Four bodies have been removed to un
dertaking' rooms.
Forty-two persons arc at the Emergency
Hospital.
Among the dead are:
Rev. W. A. Slack, professor at Tufts Col
lege. G. I). Bigclow, conductor.
Unknown man and woman.
The injured include James Reardon, John
J. O'Conuor, Thomas F. Ford, Mrs. J. R.
Wilson, Nellie Jackson, Lucy Dolan, F.
W. Tceling, and Mrs. F. A. reck
There seems to be no doubt thatatleast
eight persons were immediately killed.
The explosion came Jutt as the streetcars
were almost in the ceutcr of the space at
the corner.
The first car was In the center when the
explosion came. The whole of the wood
work, which is used as a bridge over the
subway, was lifted into the air, carrying
the first car with it and taking along the
two horses of the second car. The other
Tehlcles were lifted straight into the air,
but came down on the tracks. Instantly
the air was filled with flying debris.
The firat electric car, the one in which
most or the killed were riding, no sooner
reached the track than It broke in hair,
and the whole portion Immediately burst
into flame. Then someone sounded a fire
alarm. This brought a large rescue force
to the scene, and almost immediately calls
were being sent out hurriedly for the am
bulances. It was an awful Eight that met the gaze
of those who were first on the scene. In
the center was the long blazing electric
car. .Close beride this were the bodies ot
the two horses killed instantly, and about
ten, twenty, thirty feet away from where
the woodwork of the car was blazing lay
the dead and wounded people. Those who
wore not injured in the cars on Boylston
6treet were Incapable ot action
at first, and people in the buildings and
stores surrounding did not know what had
occurred, but it did not take them long
to secure their senses, and almost imme
diately there was a rush to the assistance
ot the wounded.
It is stated that there was not a person
on the three cars who was not injured, and
all the wounds received were severe. Im
mediately stores and offices were con
verted into temporary hospitals until am
bulances could arrive. 1 1 was a gruesome
spectacle to see these bodies exposed on
the sidewalks.
Hose carriages were pressed into service
as ambulances, and immediately they were
started on their humane duty or getting the
maimed to the hospitals.

at Jones' undertaking rooms Is Mrs. A. M.

	<text>BOSTON'S FAMOUS SUBWAY
CHIEF EXUlXliKK CAHSOX 3BI.IS
HOW IT IS COXSTIIVC1HD,
Lecture Before Engineers' Club Feature
of the Kuglnoeiiiig Work on the Subway
Subways In Other Cities.
An exceedingly Interesting and valu
able lecture was given last evening In
North Sheffield hall by Howard A. Car
son, member of the American Society
of Civil Engineers and chief engineer
of the famous Boston subway. The
lecture was given, under the auspic&i
of the Engineers' club and was largelj
attended by citizens as well as stu
dents. Professor DuBols Introduced Mr. Car
son, who spoke on "Subways in Bos
ton, London and Elsewhere." The lec
ture was illustrated by stereopticon
views of the Boston subway and also
of some of the European subways
which Mr. Carson has visited.
The lecturer at the commencement
explained why the Boston subway was
built. "The DODulatlon of Boston 130
years ago was less than 22,000; 100 years
ao about 26,000; In 1830, in the remem
brance of many, about 82,000, while to
day the city has about 600,000. The
population of Boston doubles In about
thirty-five years.
"The use o the streets for travel In
creases faster In proportion than the
population of the city. In 1896 167,000,000
persona were carried by the street rail
ways. While the population doubles
only in twenty-flve years, travel on the
street railways doubles In about ten
years.
"The streets are no wider now than
they were one hundred years ago, and
they are not able to do the work they
are needed to do. If streets can't do
the work required of them the natural
thing to do is to build them wider or
make new streets, but the cost is too
great for this, costing perhaps $100 a
foot. If you can't Wld or.broaden the
old streets you must do the way a per
son does when a house la overcrowded
and has not land to build new by add
ing stories to the old. In the case of a
street you have to decide between an
elevatedway or a subway.
"The mere cost of erecting an elevat
ed road is only about one-half or one
third of that of a eubway, but the dam
age which has to be paid to adjacent
property owners makes the cost of the
two systems about the same. As to the
convenience and comfort of the two
methods, different persons are likely to
hold different views."
Mr. Carson then explained an elevat
ed road which Is being constructed in
Germany, where the cars are suspended
from the track Instead of running on
the raila. '
"The Boston subway is being built
under some of the most traveled streets
of the city. . For most of the distance it
is to have two tracks, but at points
there are four tracks where the cars
can run back without naming to the
end of the line. At the northern termi
nus there is an incline where the cars
i can come to the surface. Stations for
passengers are placed at convenient
distances, usually one In about 1,000
feet.
"The retaining walls of the subway
are of granite and concrete, mostly of
concrete. There are two forms of con
struction employed in the roof, one
made of steel and concrete and the oth
er the brick arch. . .
"The subway is about twenty-four
feet in width at the Incline, where there
are two tracks, and about sixteen feet
high. In the middle of the subway is a
drain, the side wa!! of which, are of
brick with open Joints, so that thfe wa
ter can eaeily find its way Into It, and
the top is covered over with flags eas
ily removed if the drain needs inspec
tion or repair.
"At the passenger stations there are
two stairways, each fifteen feet In
width. It was not Intended at first to
use elevators at all, but It may be
thought desirable to adopt them at
some stations later on.
'In the work of construction many
pipes were encountered which had to
be removed or passed under. The work
is being so performed as to cause the
least possible hindrance to travel on
the streets. In the daytime one-third
of the street is occupied for the. plant
and material used for the work, and
the other two-thirds Is left for travel.
At night about two-thirds of the street
is occupied in the work.
'Bridges are built over the excava
tions on a level with the street, so that
one passing over them will hardly no
tice the fact. The work Is done by
what is known as the slice method, by
which ten or a dozen sections are being
excavated at the same time, no two be
ing adjoining.
'There are eight fans placed at ap
propriate Intervals to ventilate the tun
nel, each fan being seven feet in diam
eter. It was feared by some that the
excavations would weaken the founda
tions of some of the high buildings, but
the work has so far advanced now that
there is seen to be no danger."
Mr. Carson olosed his lecture with a
rapid description of subways in Buda
pest, Paris, London and Glasgow, and
also a description of the use of the
shield In tunnelling.</text>
